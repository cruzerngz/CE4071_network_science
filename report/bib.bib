  abstract   = {The DBLP Computer Science Bibliography evolved from an early small experimental Web server to a popular service for the computer science community. Many design decisions and details of the public XML-records behind DBLP never were documented. This paper is a review of the evolution of DBLP. The main perspective is data modeling. In DBLP persons play a central role, our discussion of person names may be applicable to many other data bases. All DBLP data are available for your own experiments. You may either download the complete set, or use a simple XML-based API described in an online appendix.},
